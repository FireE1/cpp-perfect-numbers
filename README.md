# cpp-perfect-numbers
This is simple program for finding the [perfect numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number).

## What is a 'Perfect number':
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2 and 3, and ```1 + 2 + 3 = 6```, so 6 is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, since ```1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28```. <br />

## Why this program exist:
I got inspired by video 'The oldest unsolved problem in math' by Veritasium on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Zrv1EDIqHkY?si=NtNIFFTTAPdiy1ta), so i thought 'i want to write it as a program'. And here it is.

## Usage:
Nothing special, just start it in your console.

## Build requirements:
- C++17 (STL)
- Clang++ 17

## Planned:
- Optimize counting
- Implement multithreading
- Expand counting limits
